# Server setup for ZuMult

ZuMult is a Java EE application, so it wants a Java Web Application Server. All instances so far have been running under Apache Tomcat. 
ZuMult expects a number of additional components to be present on the server, and it needs some specific configurations for directories and for access control.
This document describes the setupt of the the ZuMult instance at the IDS Mannheim (https://zumult.ids-mannheim.de/) which has been running largely stable for a larger user-base for some years now.
